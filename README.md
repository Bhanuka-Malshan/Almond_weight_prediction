## Introduction
The **Almond Weight Prediction App** is designed for predicting almond weights using a pre-trained machine learning model. It also allows users to explore dataset distributions, train a custom classification model, and upload images for visualization.

## Features
- **Home Page**: Introduction, images, videos, and general information about the app.
- **Data Exploration**: Distribution plots (e.g., BMI distribution), gender distribution pie chart.
- **Model Training Page**: Allows users to train a **RandomForestClassifier** with customizable hyperparameters.
- **Prediction Page**: Accepts user input for various almond attributes and predicts the almond's weight.
- **Media Upload**: Option to upload images for display.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/almond-weight-prediction-app.git
